 dashi - simple RPC over messaging
###################################

`Dashi` is a messaging library built on top of `Kombu`_. It provides common
patterns such as RPC without taking over your code or forcing a choice of
async framework upon you.

Parts of dashi are inspired by the `nova.rpc`_ package of `Openstack Nova`_.
